# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `app/` hosts Expo Router screens (`index.tsx` for the difficulty picker, `question.tsx` for gameplay) and global layouts.
- `components/` contains reusable UI like `Answers` and `DifficultyButton`; co-locate new view logic here instead of the screens.
- `hooks/` holds data-fetch wrappers for the Open Trivia DB token and question flow; extend these when adding network state.
- App-wide state lives in `store.tsx`; shared types are in `types.tsx`. Platform assets flow through `assets/`, while native projects generated by `expo prebuild` live under `android/` and `ios/`.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `yarn start` boots the Expo Metro server; pair with Expo Go or simulators for live reload.
- `yarn android` / `yarn ios` install and run the native projects on an attached device or simulator.
- `yarn dev:android` and `yarn dev:ios:eas` trigger local EAS builds for release-like validation.
- `yarn lint` and `yarn format` enforce ESLint + Prettier before opening a pull request; run them proactively.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- TypeScript everywhere; prefer function components with hooks over classes.
- Follow Prettier defaults (2 spaces, single quotes, 100 character line width, trailing commas) and the `eslint-config-universe/native` rules.
- Name files and folders in PascalCase for components (`Answer.tsx`), camelCase for hooks (`useQuestions.ts`), and kebab-case for assets.

## Testing Guidelines
- Automated tests are not yet wired up; until Jest is introduced, cover changes with manual verification on both a simulator and Expo Go.
- When adding tests, colocate them under `__tests__/` next to the module under test and mirror screen/component names.
- Document manual test steps in the pull request description so reviewers can reproduce the scenario quickly.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Mirror the existing history: single-line, imperative commits (e.g., `Update splash artwork`). Group related changes together.
- Reference linked issues when available and explain user-facing impact plus any follow-up tasks.
- Include screenshots or screen recordings for UI-visible changes and note any new environment variables or build steps.
- Confirm `yarn lint` passes before requesting review to keep CI green.

## Expo & Configuration Notes
- Manage environment-sensitive values (API tokens, build IDs) via `app.json` and EAS secrets rather than hardcoding.
- Keep `expo prebuild` output checked in only when native changes are intentional; otherwise rely on managed workflow.
